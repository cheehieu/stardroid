This is the home page for the Sky Map open source project. You can find the code here and participate in all of the development activities.

You should also subscribe to the Sky Map User Forum (link at the bottom left) to get the latest user feedback and information.

To build Sky Map, you need to have install 'ant' and have downloaded a
version of the Android SDK. Then, change to the trunk/app directory and create a
local.properties file containing the location of your Android SDK. It
should have a single line that looks like this:

sdk.dir=<Path to your SDK>

Executing 'ant clean debug' will build the binary. It will be located in
the bin directory and will be named Stardroid-debug.apk. Make sure that
your device can handle binaries that don't come from the market, and you
should be good to go.
